# ChatGPT-Prompt-Engineering-for-Developers
Learning Outcomes:
- Learned how to use a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications
- Using OpenAI API, built capabilities to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible
- Learned how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks, including:
-- Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
-- Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
-- Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
-- Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)

In addition, learned two key principles for writing effective prompts:
- To systematically engineer good prompts, and
- To build a custom chatbot
